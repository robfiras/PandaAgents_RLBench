# PandaAgents_RLBench
This project aims at creating reinforcement learning agents and evolution strategies, which are benchmarked on [RLBench](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench).
It is planned to add a ROS-API in order to train in the real world as well. At the time being, all agents are designed for the Franka Emika Panda.
